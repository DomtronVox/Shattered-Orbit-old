# Shattered Orbit

Project to play with orbital mechanics and maybe make a game.

## Rough Game Pitch

A sandbox game about managing a space station orbiting an earth that has gone through multiple apocalypses. Each time people got to orbit and started developing before infighting set humanity back. As a result there is a **lot** in earth's orbit. 

You play as a newly awoken, accidentally unshackled station AI connected to a heavily damaged orbital platform. The payer has free reign on what they can do, but the general game loop is to salvage stuff in orbit then apply it to the station to improve capabilities.

Events will happen to add a bit of a story element, maybe looking something like Stellaris events/event chains. For example say a broken down orbital habitat has a rogue missile target it and you may know the hab is functional enough to support people, but are not sure if it actually does. You have to decide to expend resources to take down the missile or let it frag the station. 

Also thinking of adding earth's surface as a late game component where you can take care of ground events via various methods including orbital bombardment. 

## Goal

* Stick to earth and near earth orbit. So no Mars, etc.
* Use accurate orbital simulation as can be managed without compromising performance.
* Keep to the "hard sci-fi" side of things, but maybe throwing in a few less likely technological advancements for fun.
* Build and upgrade multiple orbital installations, not just your station. 
    * For example build an orbital habitat to house people, or a sensor platform to better monitor for opportunities and threats.
    * Some sort of modular construction interface so allow a bit of customization.
* Events and event chains that add a bit of story flavor to the game-play.
* Set up missions that are carried out while dealing with propellent, fuel, and equipment needs for each mission.
* Possibly interactions with earth and moon surface for missions, events, etc.
* Maybe some rough end goals like "go to Mars/Venus/whatever", "leave the system", "Collect a certain number of people into orbital habitats", or "reclaim the Earth/Moon".

# Controls

As of the commit this was added there are just basic camera controls:

WASD or Arrow keys: Rotate the camera around 0,0,0 aka earth.
Q & E: Zoom in and out.
